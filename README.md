Home Loan Prediction using deep learning

Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model.

Steps to be done: 

⦁    Load the dataset that is given to you

⦁    Check for null values in the dataset

⦁    Print percentage of default to payer of the dataset for the TARGET column

⦁    Balance the dataset if the data is imbalanced

⦁    Plot the balanced data or imbalanced data

⦁    Calculate Sensitivity as a metrice

and finally do the given prediction.
